(incomplete notes)

The locale must be defined correctly! Otherwise there may be encoding errors that may lead pilberry to crash.

Steps required to install pilberry (dependencies are already installed):

# cd path_to_pilberry/install/
# cp pilberry /etc/init.d/
# update-rc.d pilberry defaults


The same seems to have been done with the bootup_message script

cmus config: ? in cmus, :set status_display_program=/home/user/.cmus/status_display_program.sh
